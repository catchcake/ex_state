# Machines

A **state machine** is a finite set of [states](./statenodes.html) that can transition to each other deterministically due to events. A **statechart** is an extension of state machines; mainly, they can have:

- [Hierarchical](./hierarchical.html) (or nested) states
- [Orthogonal](./parallel.html) (or parallel) states
- [History](./history.html) states
- And more, as described in [Statecharts: a Visual Formalism for Complex Systems](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf).
